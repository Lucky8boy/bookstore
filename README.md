# bookstore
 I am making a "virtual bookstore" only using C++. I know I could use MySQL, but it would be easier tbh.
 Btw, it works on Linux based systems.

# How to compile
 Type in the terminal "make run" if it is the first time. If there are changes made, use before "make clean".
 You have to be in the same folder as the 'Makefile'.
